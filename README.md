## Simulation and Docs for Boost Converter Circuit Design

1. `LTspice/`: contains all LTspice simulation source files;
1. `MATLAB/`: contains scripts that will help to understand the behaviour of the circuit, such as its efficienfy, gain, and ripple. It may help for components selection. Further work may be added here, such as additional simulation;
1. `Docs/`: contains documentation regarding some ideas and study notes;
1. `KiCad/`: contains schematic and pcb design for the boost converter.
